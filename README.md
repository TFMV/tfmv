## Current Projects

### FuzzyMatchFinder

A Go solution for approximate entity matching, focusing on standardizing street addresses in the USA. This project utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in entity resolution tasks.

### PromptTriad

An innovative Go API hosted on Cloud Run that leverages three competing AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, and Coherence) to collaboratively engineer and optimize the best possible prompt from any given input. The project focuses on integrating these APIs, implementing response evaluation using cosine similarity, and providing robust logging and monitoring.

### GCS2Postgres

A Go-based solution designed to load various open data formats stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery into a PostgreSQL database. It supports multiple file formats, utilizes BigQuery for data processing, and ensures secure PostgreSQL credentials retrieval from Google Secret Manager.

### LinguisticLens

An API for analyzing text using OpenAI's language model, focusing on emotional, factual, and implicit aspects. It identifies and explores dark triad traits, hidden meanings, and tonal nuances to provide a comprehensive text analysis. Built using the Gin framework.

### BQ Multi Agent

A platform leveraging multiple AI agents to interact with Google BigQuery for enhanced data analytics. This project aims to optimize query performance and provide insightful data analytics through a multi agent architecture.

### ArrowLake

A data lakehouse architecture integrating Apache Arrow and Iceberg to optimize large-scale data processing, analytics, and real-time streaming. This project includes vector database integration using pgvector for GenAI, LLMs, and transformer architectures, and leverages Storj for decentralized, secure, and scalable cloud storage.

## Core Values

- **Innovation**: Continuously pushing the boundaries of technology to create solutions that not only meet current needs but also foresee and address future challenges.
- **Leadership**: Building and nurturing teams that are not only technically proficient but also innovative and forward-thinking.
- **Excellence**: Consistently striving to exceed expectations through high-quality work and persistent dedication to improving and evolving in all aspects of technology and leadership.

## 🧠 Who I Am

Hi, I’m TFMV but you can call me Tom. I build weirdly fast tools, write sharp technical essays, and occasionally name my projects after cartoons.  
My work lives somewhere between operating systems and metaphysics. Also sometimes in `/tmp`.

I like:
- 🦆 DuckDB, Apache Arrow, Go, Rust
- 🧪 Entity resolution, vector search, zero-copy data movement
- 🧹 Cleaning up dev machines like they're crime scenes (`sweeper.sh`)
- 💥 Making analytics engines cry

---

## 🙃 Projects That Might Be Useful

- [**Sweeper**](https://github.com/TFMV/sweeper): Secure, zero-trust cleanup for your dev machine. Comes with `--nuclear` mode. Use wisely.
- [**Resolve**](https://github.com/TFMV/resolve): Semantic entity matching engine. Knows who you *really* are.
- [**Icebox**](https://github.com/TFMV/icebox): A single-binary Apache Iceberg playground. Batteries included, cloud optional.
- [**Quiver**](https://github.com/TFMV/quiver): Hybrid vector database built on Apache Arrow. Fast enough to question reality.

## 🙏 How You Can Help

I’m building a lot of open-source stuff, mostly solo.  
If something here made your life easier (or weirder), I’d be thrilled if you:

- ⭐️ Star a repo
- 🐛 File a bug
- 🧠 Open a discussion
- 💬 Say hi

Or just tell someone about that weird project with the cartoon name that *actually worked*.

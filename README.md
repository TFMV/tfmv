## Current Projects üî•

### BigQuery BigFunctions

As an active contributor to the open-source BigFunctions project, I help develop advanced SQL functions that extend the capabilities of Google BigQuery, enabling more efficient and powerful data transformations and analyses.

### üîç FuzzyMatchFinder

A Go solution for approximate entity matching, focusing on standardizing street addresses in the USA. This project utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in entity resolution tasks.

### üß† PromptTriad

An innovative Go API hosted on Cloud Run that leverages three competing AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, and Cohere) to collaboratively engineer and optimize the best possible prompt from any given input. The project focuses on integrating these APIs, implementing response evaluation using cosine similarity, and providing robust logging and monitoring.

### :elephant: GCS2Postgres

A Go-based solution designed to load various open data formats stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery into a PostgreSQL database. It supports multiple file formats, utilizes BigQuery for data processing, and ensures secure PostgreSQL credentials retrieval from Google Secret Manager.

### :eyeglasses: LinguisticLens

An API for analyzing text using OpenAI's language model, focusing on emotional, factual, and implicit aspects. It identifies and explores dark triad traits, hidden meanings, and tonal nuances to provide a comprehensive text analysis. Built using the Gin framework.

### ü§ñ BQ Multi Agent

A platform leveraging multiple AI agents to interact with Google BigQuery for enhanced data analytics. This project aims to optimize query performance and provide insightful data analytics through a multi agent architecture.

### :bow_and_arrow: ArrowLake

A data lakehouse architecture integrating Apache Arrow and Iceberg to optimize large-scale data processing, analytics, and real-time streaming. This project includes vector database integration using pgvector for GenAI, LLMs, and transformer architectures, and leverages Storj for decentralized, secure, and scalable cloud storage.

### :small_airplane: Flight

A Go implementation of the Apache Arrow Flight SQL protocol. This project enables efficient, high-performance data transport using Arrow Flight, facilitating interoperability and enhancing the data processing capabilities of modern data systems.
